# TOEIC 공부하는 친구를 위해 간단한거 만들어보는 중

typeScript 적용 후 module not found Error 발생.
ts, tsx 확장자를 자동으로 못읽어주는건가? 하는 의심이 들었음
그럼 설정일 것 같은데

1. dependency 다 밀고 다시 npm install 해봄 -> 실패
2. webPack 설정 파일 꺼내서 resolve 부분 수정 -> 실패

어차피 표현법에 익숙해지기 위해 현재 과정은 반복할 거기 때문에
새로운 프로젝트 만들어서 또 해보고 다시 와서 수정하자

단, 에러 수정 실패로 느낀건 React 프로젝트의 개념과 설정에 대한 이해도가 낮기 때문이라고 보고
CRA 없이 만들어보자

그럼 설정에 대한 이해가 어느정도 생기지 않을까?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
